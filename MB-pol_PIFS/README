MBX_PIFS_CMAKE.tar.gz contains MBX for MB-pol(PIFS).
To use MB-pol(PIFS), use water monomer name as "h2o_mb" (in LAMMPS fix)
Monomer name as "h2o" in this copy is the (original) MB-pol.

--- 
MB-Fit_PIFS.tar.gz contains a modified MB-Fit software used to generate PIFS. The original (unmodified) MB-fit is available and documented at https://github.com/paesanilab/MB-Fit.

To generate PIFS, instead of using
     mbfit.generate_polynomials(dim_settings, poly_in, polynomial_order, poly_directory, generate_direct_gradients=True)
use
     mbfit.generate_polynomials(dim_settings, poly_in, polynomial_order, poly_directory, generate_direct_gradients=True, poly_version=2)

In poly-filters/ :
  > `poly_in` (python string: path to "poly.in") used to generate the PEFs can be found in this folder.
