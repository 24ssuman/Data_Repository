The molecular models of NU-1500-Cr in the format of MBX interface with LAMMPS.

Files description:

unsaturated_framework: NU-1500-Cr framework with unsaturated Cr sites. Only partial Cr sites are saturated by chlorides.

saturated_framework: NU-1500-Cr framework with all Cr sites saturated with water molecules or chlorides. This configuration is considered as the "empty" framework in this study. See J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 2900âˆ’2905 and the crystallography data in its Supporting Information.

saturated_framework_+512w: NU-1500-Cr framework with all Cr sites saturated with water molecules or chlorides, with additional 512 water molecules loaded via Packmol (i.e. in total 16 + 512 = 528 water molecules).

lmp_npt_mbpol: the LAMMPS input file for running isothermal-isobaric ensemble MD simulations with MB-pol.

lmp_nve_mbpol: the LAMMPS input file for running microcanonical ensemble MD simulations with MB-pol.

CONFIG.01: the DLPOLY2 input file for the initial configuration of the NU-1500-Cr loaded with 512 additional water molecules.

FINAL_CONFIG.01: the DLPOLY2 output file for the last configuration of NU-1500-Cr loaded with 512 additional water molecules after randomization and full 1 ns NPT run.

Remark:

It should be noted that DLPOLY_2 and LAMMPS have different conventions of the same functional forms. As a result, the force field parameters documented in the Supporting Information are converted to align LAMMPS convention in LAMMPS input files.
