The molecular models of NU-1500-Cr in the format of MBX interface with LAMMPS.

Files description:

unsaturated_framework: NU-1500-Cr framework with unsaturated Cr sites. Only partial Cr sites are saturated by chlorides.

saturated_framework: NU-1500-Cr framework with all Cr sites saturated with water molecules or chlorides. This configuration is considered as the "empty" MOF in this study. See in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 2900âˆ’2905 and the crystallography data in its Supporting Information.

saturated_framework_+512w: NU-155-Cr framework with all Cr sites saturated with water molecules or chlorides, with additional 512 water molecules loaded via Packmol (i.e. in total 16 + 512 = 528 water molecules).

lmp_npt_mbpol: the LAMMPS input file for running isothermal-isobaric ensemble MD simulations with MB-pol.

lmp_nve_mbpol: the LAMMPS input file for running microcanonical ensemble MD simulations with MB-pol.

Remark:

It should be noted that DLPOLY_2 and LAMMPS have different conventions of the same functional forms.
