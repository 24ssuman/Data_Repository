# Many-body interactions and deep neural network potentials for water
## Yaoguang Zhai, Richa Rashmi, Etienne Palos, and Francesco Paesani1

This reposiroy contains the potentials associated with the analyses presented in the paper.
They are in the DeepMD format for LAMMPs.

The DNN@MB-pol potential is lcoated in the original repository: https://github.com/paesanilab/Data_Repository/tree/main/Quantum-phase-diagram-of-water/Deep_Neural_Network_Potential
